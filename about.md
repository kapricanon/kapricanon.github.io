<div class="about-artistic">
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Sveta, a self taught string artist passionate about transforming simple threads into bold, contemporary art.
  </p>
  <p>
    Untangle My String Art began from a very personal place. I started nailing into a wooden board as a way to release years of suppressed emotions. With every nail, something inside me softened. With every thread, my mind felt a little clearer.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I worked through my own knots of life, the process became deeply therapeutic. It helped me slow down, focus on the moment, and express emotions I didn’t yet have words for. That’s where the name Untangle came from because, piece by piece, the process untangled the many knots in my mind, one at a time.
  </p>
  <p>
    What started as personal healing soon grew into creating meaningful, personalised pieces for friends and family, celebrating milestones, memories, and moments that matter. Seeing the joy and connection these pieces brought to others showed me the power of art as expression.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nature inspires much of my work, along with causes close to my heart such as mental health awareness, cancer support, and the full spectrum of human emotion. Each piece tells a story, not just in its final form, but in the process of creating it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also love maths, and only later realised that string art naturally weaves mathematics into its symmetry and geometry. That discovery felt intentional, a beautiful connection between logic, creativity, and emotion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, alongside creating bespoke string art pieces, I run wellbeing workshops for people of all ages and abilities. These workshops share the same experience that once helped me: using nails, thread, and focused creation as a way to express, release, and begin untangling what we carry inside.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether it’s a personalised artwork or a shared workshop space, my work is about one thing, expression that leads to clarity, and the gentle untangling of life’s knots.
