<p>I am a String artist and I draw inspiration from nature, emotions and interconnection of life.<br>
I am a Lippan artist and I draw inspiration from the culture and tradition of the state I come from in India.</p>

<p>I am a self-taught String artist and love to transform threads into captivating pieces of art. Born and brought up in India and now based in Milton Keynes, I started doing string art in 2019 and developed various unique styles of this art since then. I draw inspiration from nature, emotions and interconnectedness of life. Each piece that I create is meticulously crafted combining technique, patience and creativity. From being an Interior Designer to becoming an Early yearsâ€™ teacher and a keen Vedic mathematician, I also love bringing some design and Maths aspects into my string art and using the duo to create intricate symmetric pieces that involves simple to complex mathematical calculations.<br>
I enjoy creating pieces around meaningful themes supporting specific causes and recently had a solo string art exhibition at Westbury Artsâ€™ Centre showcasing pieces supporting and promoting mental well-being.<br><br>

In addition to creating string art I am also passionate about creating Lippan art- a traditional artwork from Kutch village in Gujarat, India, where I originally come from. Lippan means clay. The artwork involves creating intricate designs using clay and mirrors. It mainly depicts the traditional culture and motifs of animals, birds, village people and their daily lives.<br><br>

I run workshops and classes for both art styles in Milton Keynes in person and online.</p>
