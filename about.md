  <p>
    Hi, I’m Sveta—a modern string artist passionate about transforming simple threads into bold, contemporary art. My work is inspired by the energy of nature, the rhythm of city life, and the stories that connect us all.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started my creative journey in Gujarat, India, and now create from my studio in Milton Keynes. Since 2019, I’ve been blending design, teaching, and a love for Vedic maths into vibrant, geometric string art that’s both fresh and meaningful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside string art, I craft <strong>Lippan art</strong>—a stunning fusion of clay and mirrorwork from Kutch—bringing a modern twist to this beautiful tradition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you’re after a custom piece, want to join a hands-on workshop, or just want to explore the world of string and Lippan art, I’m here to help you discover something new and inspiring.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Let’s create something unforgettable together!</em>
  </p>
