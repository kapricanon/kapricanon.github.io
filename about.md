<div class="about-artistic">
Thank you for visiting my website.<br><br>
I am a self-taught String artist and love to transform threads into captivating pieces of art. Born and brought up in India and now based in Milton Keynes, I started doing string art in 2019 and developed various unique styles of this art since then. I draw inspiration from nature, emotions and interconnectedness of life. Each piece that I create is meticulously crafted combining technique, patience and creativity. From being an Interior Designer to becoming an Early yearsâ€™ teacher and a keen Vedic mathematician, I also love bringing some design and Maths aspects into my string art and using them to create intricate symmetric pieces that involves simple to complex mathematical calculations.<br>
I enjoy creating pieces around meaningful themes and supporting specific causes.<br><br>
I also create Lippan art- a traditional art style from my hometown in Gujarat using clay and mirrors.<br><br>
I run workshops and classes for both art styles in Milton Keynes in person and online.
